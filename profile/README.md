## NAU CS Capstone Team #12

# What are we doing?
We are Team Physh, and we are working together to create a cross platform application for our client, David Rogowski who is a Wildlife Specialist Regional Supervisor for the Arizona Game and Fish Department. They have some real challenges in the area of gathering fish data but we are confident that we are on track to provide them with a very effective solution. Whereas before it took each angler having to contact a scientist to gather or push data, our solution should be able to remove this problem by creating a cross platform app that allows local anglers to gather and look at fish data. Our hope is that our application will help manage the Lees Ferry fishery, and in addition that this application could also be used by others that utilize a mark recapture program and PIT tags in their research. There are multiple mark-recapture programs around the country and the world that would benefit from the development of this application.
